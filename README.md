# ServianApp
My take on Servian Take Home Project

I have deployed using two IaC tools firstly, we create a dev environment locally using Vagrant as a devops you tend to provide developer the same environement you will be deploying. Secondly with using AWS ecs-ec2 cluster and rds postgre database deployment.
